# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses a vanilla JavaScript modular architecture with ES6 modules:

- **Modular Design**: Core functionality split into specialized modules (app.js, storage.js, api.js, charts.js, renderers.js)
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: CSS grid and flexbox layout optimized for screens â‰¥360px width
- **Single Page Application**: Dynamic page switching without full reloads using JavaScript routing
- **Offline-First Strategy**: LocalStorage as primary storage with Google Sheets sync capability

## Backend Architecture
**Google Apps Script Web App** serves as the backend:
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Token-based authentication for security
- Direct Google Sheets integration for data persistence
- CORS-enabled for cross-origin requests

## Data Storage Solutions
**Dual Storage Strategy**:
- **Primary**: Google Sheets via Apps Script API for cloud persistence and collaboration
- **Fallback**: Browser LocalStorage for offline functionality and performance
- **Sync Logic**: Bidirectional synchronization between local and cloud storage with conflict resolution

## Authentication and Authorization
- **Token-based authentication**: Simple API token validation in Google Apps Script
- **Configurable access**: Users set up their own Google Apps Script deployment with custom tokens
- **No user accounts**: Direct integration with user's own Google Sheets

## Data Architecture
**Six main data entities**:
- **Daily**: Checklist items with 30-day grid tracking
- **Weekly**: Weekly goals with 4-week tracking periods
- **Monthly**: Monthly targets with 4-month tracking
- **Finance**: Income/expense transactions with budget analysis
- **Business**: Business transactions with profit/loss tracking
- **Settings**: User preferences, categories, and API configuration

## Visualization Strategy
**Chart.js integration** for dashboard analytics:
- Line charts for daily progress trends
- Bar charts for weekly/monthly comparisons
- Donut charts for category breakdowns
- Clustered charts for business analytics
